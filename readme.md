# Algo Team

This is the codebase for members of the algorithms team.

Your top priority is to devise fast, efficient algorithms for use in the
project. It's up to you to determine what's complex enough to warrant your work;
the most important thing, though, is the matcher for tutors and students.

Things to think about:
* Does your change create an *order of magnitude* improvement on the existing
  code? Is the time or space complexity changed, or is the constant
  significantly reduced?
* What feature will your change help? If none, can you think of one?
* Focus on getting it working, then focus on getting it right.
